**Digital Certified Delivery Simplest Prototype Example ‚Äî Reinvented for the Email Era**

## The Problem

Every year, businesses and individuals spend **billions** on USPS Certified Mail and courier services just to prove that a critical document was sent, received, and opened.
This legacy system is:

* **Slow** ‚Äî delivery takes days, not seconds.
* **Expensive** ‚Äî \$7‚Äì\$10 per Certified Mail piece (plus staff handling).
* **Inefficient** ‚Äî requires in-person handling, return receipts, and manual filing.
* **Risk-prone** ‚Äî mail theft and lost items remain common.

In today‚Äôs digital world, organizations need **court-admissible proof of email delivery** ‚Äî faster, cheaper, and more secure than physical certified mail.
